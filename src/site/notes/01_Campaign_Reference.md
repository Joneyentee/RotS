## Royal Succession Crisis

**High King Everglade** (Deceased Session 23)  
├── **Gaelin** (1st son, deceased) → with Elincia Flowers → **Alvar & Yavanna** (bastards, EXCLUDED)  
├── **Second Son** (deceased "at sea") → with Verona → **AVICIA** (RIGHTFUL HEIR)  
└── **[Third line]** → **Crown Princess Eilrora** (currently ruling, GRANDDAUGHTER)

**Three-Way Dispute:**

1. Crown Princess (Eagle faction, ruling, junior claim)
2. Falcon bastards (Elincia/Alvar/Yavanna, attacking, illegitimate)
3. Avicia (rightful heir, hidden, identity SECRET - only party + Patriarch + Princess + Eldrin know)

**"The Vessel" = Avicia** (confirmed - Elincia failed to retrieve her)

---

## Organizations

- **Riders of the Storm** - Party, **Marshals of the North**, 732 troops + Seraphine (healer), Bane Watchers (all initiated Session 18)

- **Moth Queen Cult** - **S32**: Attacking Crossroads Inn crops, cavern entrance discovered
- **Gnome Army** - Barry leads, revenge on Odonia

---

## Important Secrets & Relationships

**CRITICAL SECRETS:**

- Avicia is rightful heir (only party + Patriarch + Princess + Eldrin know)
- Odonia made assassination arrangement with Princess (meta-knowledge - party unaware except Odonia)
- Dormant Bane commands in ToooAh/Odonia/Patriarch (party aware)
- Elvva's corruption CRITICAL (sprite manifestation, overflow risk)
- Elincia = Thalas = Lady Alysanne (triple identity now known to party)

**KEY RELATIONSHIPS:**

- ToooAh adopted Avicia (enormous stakes, education decision pending)
- Elik'r connected to Purple Dragonborn (calls his name from ancient past)
- Yavanna had relations with Elik'r (unaware of connection to Alvar)
- Barry/gnome army seek revenge on Odonia (shot in eye)
- Co'narr distrusts Crown Princess
- Elik'r severe guilt (forced to kill Elvva in vision, Guy's death, ~25 friendly fire casualties Session 25)
- Odonia private meeting with Princess Session 26 (assassination arrangement confirmed)

**STRATEGIC POSITIONS:**

- Odonia: Lady of Sylobelle (land ownership), Royal Advisor (left of throne)
- Party: Marshals of the North, 712 troops, war chest access
- Stormhold Keep: Official deed granted
- Base secure but castle inaccessible (too far for immediate return)

---

## The Bane

**Nature:** Evil incarnate, pure corruption, "the earth itself" (living entity), feeds on chaos  
**History:** Corrupted dwarves in First Age, imprisoned by dragon gods (one died), released when party blew horn  
**Current:** Active, strong presence in Belendar, corrupting Elvva (sprite manifestation)  
**Capabilities:** Plants dormant commands, psychological curses, corrupts magic (green glow), sprite manifestation = advanced corruption, can overflow and take over host, shortens lifespan  
**Detection:** Party has Bane Sense (currently unfocused, overwhelming)  
**Threats:** Elvva's sprite manifestation (CRITICAL), dormant commands, progressive influence, overflow risk

**Co'narr's Knowledge (Session 26):**

- Bane Watchers have "sad existence"
- Can shorten lifespan
- More attuned = worse corruption
- Can overflow and take over host
- Sprites = normal manifestation
- Citadel visit URGENT for training/cure
